## Repo purpuse
This repo contains input files generated using the _input_gen.py_ script provided by the professor and, for each input file, the corresponding output returned by my script.
I hope this files help the students who need to troubleshoot their solution.

### Disclaimer
Although my solution successfully passed each test available in the valutation software, I cannot gurantee that the code is bug-free.

In order to avoid copyright issues, the script _input_gen.py_ is not uploaded here; students with their credentials can download the file through the website of the valutation software.
